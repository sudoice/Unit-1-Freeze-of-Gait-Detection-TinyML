This project focuses on detecting Freezing of Gait (FoG) in Parkinson’s disease patients using TinyML. By leveraging machine learning models optimized for microcontrollers, it enables real-time, on-device detection of FoG episodes. The solution integrates sensor data from wearable hardware to monitor gait patterns and trigger alerts during abnormal events, aiming to enhance patient mobility and safety.

Some potential use cases for the *Freeze of Gait (FoG) Detection using TinyML* project:

- **Wearable Health Monitoring for Parkinson’s Patients**: Continuous monitoring of gait patterns in Parkinson’s disease patients using a wearable device to detect FoG episodes and alert caregivers or medical professionals in real-time.<br>
- **Smart Home Integration**: Integrating FoG detection with smart home systems to automatically adjust the environment (e.g., unlocking doors, turning on lights, or adjusting temperature) when FoG episodes are detected, improving patient safety.<br>
- **Remote Patient Monitoring**: Healthcare providers can remotely monitor patients' gait data and receive alerts for FoG occurrences, enabling timely intervention and better management of the disease.<br>
- **Assistive Mobility Devices**: Embedding FoG detection in assistive devices like walkers or canes, allowing these devices to alert the user or provide additional support when a freeze of gait episode occurs.<br>
- **Clinical Research and Data Collection**: The project can be used in clinical studies to gather real-time gait data from Parkinson's patients, aiding in research on disease progression and treatment effectiveness.<br>
