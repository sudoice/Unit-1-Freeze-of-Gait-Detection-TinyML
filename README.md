This project focuses on detecting Freezing of Gait (FoG) in Parkinsonâ€™s disease patients using TinyML. By leveraging machine learning models optimized for microcontrollers, it enables real-time, on-device detection of FoG episodes. The solution integrates sensor data from wearable hardware to monitor gait patterns and trigger alerts during abnormal events, aiming to enhance patient mobility and safety.
